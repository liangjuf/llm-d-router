# P/D Capacity Admission POC Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Add a deployment-wide hysteretic admission plugin that returns HTTP 429 when every prefill or decode endpoint is unavailable according to fresh queue and KV signals.

**Architecture:** Keep the pre-tokenization flow-control queue unchanged and implement resource admission at the post-data-producer `Admitter` extension point. A `PoolScopedAdmitter` receives a lazy full-pool snapshot callback, leaving ordinary admitters and scheduling on their request-filtered candidates. The plugin evaluates role-specific thresholds but retains one pool-wide open/closed state per EPP plugin instance. Metric values and observation times are immutable samples. Raw request bytes remain a queue-memory guard rather than an inference-cost estimate.

**Tech Stack:** Go, llm-d EPP plugin framework, SGLang endpoint metrics, controller-runtime logging, testify.

## Global Constraints

- Work only in `/home/coder/llm-d-router-decode-prealloc-admission-control` on branch `lfeng/decode-prealloc-admission-control`.
- Follow test-driven development: every production behavior must first have a focused failing test.
- Do not modify existing scheduling filters or scorers.
- Evaluate explicitly labeled P/D endpoint roles from the full protected pool, independently of request candidate subsets.
- Admit only when at least one prefill-capable and one decode-capable endpoint are feasible.
- Missing, zero-timestamp, or stale endpoint metrics make that endpoint unavailable.
- Metrics freshness and queue/KV trip and recovery thresholds are configurable.
- Preserve typed `ResourceExhausted` admission denials as HTTP 429; all other denial errors retain HTTP 500 behavior.
- Do not deploy, build an image, push, or perform public actions.

## Hysteresis Iteration

1. Add immutable per-signal value/time samples in the metrics attribute and extractor packages. Verify extraction, partial scrape retention, invalid values, and interleaved publication before changing admission to consume them.
2. Add the optional full-pool admission interface and Director dispatch. Verify request subsets remain in scheduling and ordinary admission, while the pool callback reads all protected endpoints lazily.
3. Retain one synchronized breaker state. Preserve trip thresholds; recover strictly below prefill/decode waiting 2, preallocation 4, and KV 0.85 by default. Verify transition sequences, bounds, stale/invalid samples, priority bypass, and concurrent snapshot/state access.
4. Add a state gauge and transition logs; document initialization, replica-local state, request-driven recovery, and unchanged empty-candidate behavior.
5. Run focused extraction, admission, Director, and runner tests, concurrency tests with `-race`, and changed-code lint. Keep changes local; no push or public PR edits.

### Task 1: Preserve ResourceExhausted From Admission Plugins

**Files:**
- Modify: `pkg/epp/requestcontrol/director_test.go`
- Modify: `pkg/epp/requestcontrol/director.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `runAdmissionPlugins(...) error`
- Produces: `HandleRequest` preserves only typed `errcommon.ResourceExhausted` admission errors.

- [ ] **Step 1: Add failing Director cases**

Add a wrapped `errcommon.Error{Code: errcommon.ResourceExhausted}` denial expecting `ResourceExhausted`, plus a typed `BadRequest` denial expecting `Internal`. Keep the existing untyped denial case expecting `Internal`.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the focused test and confirm RED**

Run `go test ./pkg/epp/requestcontrol -run '^TestDirector_HandleRequest$' -count=1`. The ResourceExhausted case must fail because the Director returns `Internal`.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement the minimal preservation rule**

Use `errors.As` in the admission-denial block. Return the recovered typed error only when its code is `errcommon.ResourceExhausted`; otherwise retain the existing `Internal` wrapper.

- [ ] **Step 4: Run the focused test and confirm GREEN**

Run the command from Step 2 and require exit code 0.

- [ ] **Step 5: Commit**

Run `git add pkg/epp/requestcontrol/director.go pkg/epp/requestcontrol/director_test.go` and `git commit -s -m "Preserve admission resource exhaustion errors"`.

### Task 2: Implement the Role-Aware P/D Capacity Admitter

**Files:**
- Create: `pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity/plugin.go`
- Create: `pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity/plugin_test.go`

**Interfaces:**
- Produces: plugin type `pd-capacity-admitter` implementing `requestcontrol.Admitter` and `plugin.ConsumerPlugin`.
- Consumes: core endpoint metrics and configured scalar custom-metric attributes.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write failing factory and dependency tests**

Cover defaults, malformed duration, non-positive queue thresholds, invalid KV fraction, and strict-decoder compatibility for deprecated fields.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run package tests and confirm RED**

Run `go test ./pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity -count=1`. Compilation must fail because implementation is absent.

- [ ] **Step 3: Implement configuration and validation**

Implement this configuration shape and defaults:

```yaml
rejectAllPriorities: true
metricsStalenessThreshold: 12s
decode:
  waitingQueueThreshold: 4
  kvCacheUtilizationThreshold: 0.92
  prealloc:
    attributeKey: sglang.decode_prealloc_queue_reqs
    threshold: 8
prefill:
  waitingQueueThreshold: 4
```

Prefill admission uses engine-observed ordinary waiting only. It does not use EPP-local in-flight state.
Decode transfer-queue depth is excluded from admission because it represents normal pipeline occupancy; scheduling filters and scorers may still use it for endpoint selection.

- [ ] **Step 4: Write failing behavior tests**

Cover one feasible rank per role; all-decode prealloc, ordinary-waiting, and KV-utilization rejection; request size, KV capacity, and high transfer depth remaining non-gating; one healthy decode bypassing overloaded peers; all-prefill ordinary-waiting rejection; stale/zero/missing metrics; missing custom metrics; hybrid roles; unlabeled roles; priority bypass; and typed `ResourceExhausted` denials.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run tests and confirm RED**

Run the Task 2 package test and confirm the behavior tests fail for missing logic.

- [ ] **Step 6: Implement endpoint evaluation**

Decode feasibility requires fresh ordinary-waiting, preallocation, and KV-utilization metrics; queue values below thresholds; and KV usage below threshold. Request size and projected free KV tokens are excluded because the snapshot does not reserve capacity or bind scheduling to the endpoint that passed admission.

Prefill feasibility requires a fresh engine-reported ordinary waiting queue below threshold. EPP-local in-flight token state is intentionally excluded so admission remains replica-independent.

Return typed `ResourceExhausted` only when no feasible endpoint exists for at least one role. Emit one operational rejection log plus debug endpoint-unavailability logs without request payloads.

- [ ] **Step 7: Run package tests and confirm GREEN**

Run the Task 2 package test and require exit code 0.

- [ ] **Step 8: Commit**

Run `git add pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity` and `git commit -s -m "Add P/D capacity admission plugin"`.

---

### Task 3: Register and Document the Plugin

**Files:**
- Modify: `cmd/epp/runner/runner.go`
- Create: `cmd/epp/runner/pd_capacity_admitter_test.go`
- Create: `pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity/README.md`

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: `pdcapacity.Factory`
- Produces: Alpha registration under `pd-capacity-admitter` and a complete top-level YAML example.

- [ ] **Step 1: Write a failing registration test**

Follow `cmd/epp/runner/decode_pipeline_pressure_filter_test.go`: register all plugins, look up `pd-capacity-admitter`, and require a non-nil Alpha factory.

- [ ] **Step 2: Run the registration test and confirm RED**

Run `go test ./cmd/epp/runner -run '^TestPDCapacityAdmitterRegistered$' -count=1` and require a missing-registration failure.

- [ ] **Step 3: Import and register the plugin**

Register `pdcapacity.PluginType` with `fwkplugin.StabilityAlpha` beside the existing admission plugins.

- [ ] **Step 4: Document behavior and configuration**

Document that the plugin is top-level, retains one pool-wide breaker state, treats missing/stale/invalid samples as endpoint-unavailable, and runs after data producers. Document recovery thresholds, replica-local state, the state gauge, and that an enabled earlier flow-control gate can queue requests before this plugin executes.

- [ ] **Step 5: Run registration and focused tests**

Run:

```text
go test ./cmd/epp/runner -run '^TestPDCapacityAdmitterRegistered$' -count=1
go test ./pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity -count=1
go test ./pkg/epp/requestcontrol -run '^TestDirector_HandleRequest$' -count=1
```

All commands must exit 0.

- [ ] **Step 6: Commit**

Run `git add cmd/epp/runner/runner.go cmd/epp/runner/pd_capacity_admitter_test.go pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity/README.md` and `git commit -s -m "Register P/D capacity admission plugin"`.

### Task 4: Verify the Branch

**Files:**
- Modify only files required by formatter output from this feature.

**Interfaces:**
- Consumes: Tasks 1-3.
- Produces: fresh verification evidence for the complete branch.

- [ ] **Step 1: Run `make format`**
- [ ] **Step 2: Run `go test ./pkg/epp/framework/plugins/requestcontrol/admitter/pdcapacity ./pkg/epp/requestcontrol ./cmd/epp/runner -count=1`**
- [ ] **Step 3: Run `make presubmit`**
- [ ] **Step 4: Run `git status --short`, `git diff --check`, and `git log --oneline 8501cdb20d7fd550c103208da3fda3e30c8a5d35..HEAD` and verify scope.**
